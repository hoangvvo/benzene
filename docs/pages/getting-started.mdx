# Getting Started

This tutorial will take us through the process of building a GraphQL server with `@benzene/http` and `@benzene/ws`. We will build a simple book voting app that can:

- Returns a list of books and authors
- Upvote a book
- Synchronize votes with real-time changes

Everything will be built with the bare [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) module and the [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library. We can adapt it to any other libraries.

In this tutorial, we will use the *SDL-first* library [graphql-tools](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools) for our schema. (However, we can choose *code-first* libraries likes [type-graphql](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql) and [@nexus/schema](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/schema))

Check out the [source code](https://github.com/hoangvvo/benzene/tree/main/examples/book-votes) or follow along.

## Setup Project

Create a project and install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
mkdir book-votes
cd book-votes
npm init -y
npm i ws graphql @benzene/http @benzene/ws @graphql-tools/schema
```

Also, make sure to [set `type` to `"module"` in `package.json`](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#packages_type) since we are working with ESModule.
(Otherwise, we can write the upcoming code in CommonJS)

## Define our schema

Create a file called `schema.js` and add the following:

```js
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
import { on, EventEmitter } from "events";

const authors = [
  { id: 1, name: "Tom Coleman" },
  { id: 2, name: "Sashko Stubailo" },
  { id: 3, name: "Mikhail Novikov" },
];

const books = [
  { id: 1, authorId: 1, title: "Introduction to GraphQL", votes: 2 },
  { id: 2, authorId: 2, title: "Welcome to Meteor", votes: 3 },
  { id: 3, authorId: 2, title: "Advanced GraphQL", votes: 1 },
  { id: 4, authorId: 3, title: "Launchpad is Cool", votes: 7 },
];

const typeDefs = `
  type Author {
    id: Int!
    name: String
    books: [Book]
  }

  type Book {
    id: Int!
    title: String
    author: Author
    votes: Int
  }

  type Query {
    books: [Book]
  }

  type Mutation {
    bookUpvote (
      bookId: Int!
    ): Book
  }

  type Subscription {
    bookSubscribe: Book
  }
`;

const ee = new EventEmitter();

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    books: () => books,
  },

  Mutation: {
    bookUpvote: (_, { bookId }) => {
      const book = books.find((book) => book.id === bookId);
      if (!book) {
        throw new Error(`Couldn't find book with id ${bookId}`);
      }
      book.votes += 1;
      ee.emit("BOOK_SUBSCRIBE", { bookSubscribe: book });
      return book;
    },
  },

  Subscription: {
    bookSubscribe: {
      subscribe: async function* bookSubscribe() {
        for await (const event of on(ee, "BOOK_SUBSCRIBE")) {
          yield event[0];
        }
      },
    },
  },

  Author: {
    books: (author) => books.filter((book) => book.authorId === author.id),
  },

  Book: {
    author: (book) => authors.find((author) => author.id === book.authorId),
  },
};

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

export default schema;
```

We created a GraphQL schema with three functionalities:

- A query to retrieve all books, as well resolvers for *Book* and *Author* to resolve nested fields.
- A mutation to upvote a book, which also announces the change to the `"BOOK_SUBSCRIBE"` event.
- A subscription to book updates that listens to the `"BOOK_SUBSCRIBE"` event.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  We use [events.on](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_events_on_emitter_eventname_options)
to create the async iterator, but you may be more familiar with [graphql-subscriptions](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions))
</Callout>

## Create the server

Create a file called `server.js` and add the following:

```js
import { createServer } from "http";
import WebSocket from "ws";
import { Benzene, parseGraphQLBody, makeHandler } from "@benzene/http";
import { makeHandler as makeHandlerWs } from "@benzene/ws";
import schema from "./schema.js";

function readBody(request) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    let body = "";
    request.on("data", (chunk) => (body += chunk));
    request.on("end", () => resolve(body));
  });
}

const GQL = new Benzene({ schema });

const graphqlHTTP = makeHandler(GQL);
const graphqlWS = makeHandlerWs(GQL);

const server = createServer(async (req, res) => {
  const rawBody = await readBody(req);
  const result = await graphqlHTTP({
    method: req.method,
    headers: req.headers,
    body: parseGraphQLBody(rawBody, req.headers["content-type"]),
  });
  res.writeHead(result.status, result.headers);
  res.end(JSON.stringify(result.payload));
});

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

wss.on("connection", (ws) => {
  graphqlWS(ws);
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log(`ðŸš€  Server ready at http://localhost:3000`);
});
```

### Parse incoming request

Our defined `readBody` function read the data from the incoming request and output it as a string.
Meanwhile, the [graphql-over-http spec](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http) allows different incoming [Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type),
each must be parsed differently. We provide `parseGraphQLBody` function, which accepts the body string and the content type, to do just that.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  We do not have to do this if we use a framework or library with body parsing, like [express](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.json)
</Callout>

### Create a Benzene instance and transport handlers

After creating a [Benzene instance](/reference/benzene), we create HTTP and WebSocket handler by supplying the it to the `makeHandler` functions from
`@benzene/http` and `@benzene/ws`.

`@benzene/http` is then called with a generic request object and returns a generic response object with `status`, `headers`, and `payload` so we can respond
as we wish. This allows us to work with any frameworks or runtimes.

Similarly, `@benzene/ws` is called with any [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)-like instance, so we can use it
with libraries other than `ws`.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ“¦">
  Benzene class is exported from both `@benzene/ws` and `@benzene/http`
</Callout>

### Optional: Use a different runtime

**Benzene** supports different implementations of GraphQL. If you are looking for a more performant GraphQL server,
take a look at the [runtime](/reference/runtime) documentation. Below is an example using `graphql-jit` more than 2x performance improvement.

```js
// ESModule import
import { makeCompileQuery } from "@benzene/core/runtimes/jit";
// Legacy import
import { makeCompileQuery } from "@benzene/core/dist/runtimes/jit.cjs";

const GQL = new Benzene({
  compileQuery: makeCompileQuery(),
});
```

Also, check out the [benchmarks](/benchmarks) section to learn more about the difference.

## Start the application

### Using the Svelte + urql app

Although setting up the client is not in the scope of this tutorial,
[examples/book-votes](https://github.com/hoangvvo/benzene/tree/main/examples/book-votes)
features one built with [svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/).

![book-votes-example](/book-votes-example.gif)

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/hoangvvo/benzene/tar.gz/main | tar -xz --strip=2 benzene-main/examples/book-votes
cd book-votes
npm i
npm run start
```

### Trying out with DevTools

Without building a front-end, we can still test out the Getting Started example using DevTools.

Start the Node application using

```bash
node ./server.js
```

Go to the [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and open the DevTools.

First, try to query all books:

```js
await fetch("/graphql", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    query: "query { books { id, title, author { name }, votes } }",
  }),
}).then((res) => res.json());
```

Before we make a mutation, let's try to subscribe to our books' changes using GraphQL Subscription over WebSockets.

```js
const websocket = new WebSocket("ws://localhost:3000/graphql", "graphql-transport-ws");
// Wait a bit for WebSocket to connect and then run:
websocket.send(JSON.stringify({ type: "connection_init" }));
```

Take a look at the *WS* tab in the *Network* panel. We can see an opening WebSocket communicating with our GraphQL server.
Let's try to subscribe to `bookSubscribe`.

```js
websocket.send(
  JSON.stringify({
    type: "subscribe",
    id: "1",
    payload: { query: "subscription { bookSubscribe { title, votes } }" },
  })
);
```

Now make a request to increase the vote:

```js
await fetch("/graphql", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "content-type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({ query: "mutation { bookUpvote(bookId: 1) { id } }" }),
}).then((res) => res.json());
```

We will notice a message coming from the WebSocket channel:

```json
{
  "id": "1",
  "payload": {
    "data": {
      "bookSubscribe": { "title": "Introduction to GraphQL", "votes": 5 }
    }
  },
  "type": "next"
}
```
