# Getting Started

This tutorial will take you through the process of building a GraphQL server with `@benzene/server` and `@benzene/ws`. We will build a simple posting app that can:

- Returns a list of posts and authors
- Upvote a post
- Synchronize votes with real-time changes

Everything will be built with the bare [http](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) module and the [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws) library. You can adapt it to any other libraries.

In this tutorial, we will use the *SDL-first* library [graphql-tools](https://github.com/ardatan/graphql-tools) for our schema. (However, you can choose a *code-first* libraries likes [type-graphql](https://github.com/MichalLytek/type-graphql) and [@nexus/schema](https://github.com/graphql-nexus/schema))

## Setup Project

Create a project and install the neccessary dependencies.

```bash
mkdir benzene-votes
cd benzene-votes
npm init -y
npm i ws graphql @benzene/http @benzene/ws @graphql-tools/schema
```

## Define our schema

Create a file called `schema.js` and add the following:

```js
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
import { on, EventEmitter } from "events";

const authors = [
  { id: 1, firstName: "Tom", lastName: "Coleman" },
  { id: 2, firstName: "Sashko", lastName: "Stubailo" },
  { id: 3, firstName: "Mikhail", lastName: "Novikov" },
];

const posts = [
  { id: 1, authorId: 1, title: "Introduction to GraphQL", votes: 2 },
  { id: 2, authorId: 2, title: "Welcome to Meteor", votes: 3 },
  { id: 3, authorId: 2, title: "Advanced GraphQL", votes: 1 },
  { id: 4, authorId: 3, title: "Launchpad is Cool", votes: 7 },
];

const typeDefs = `
  type Author {
    id: Int!
    name: String
    posts: [Post]
  }

  type Post {
    id: Int!
    title: String
    author: Author
    votes: Int
  }

  type Query {
    posts: [Post]
  }

  type Mutation {
    postUpvote (
      postId: Int!
    ): Post
  }

  type Subscription {
    postSubscribe: Post
  }
`;

const ee = new EventEmitter();

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    posts: () => posts,
  },

  Mutation: {
    postUpvote: (_, { postId }) => {
      const post = posts.find((post) => post.id === postId);
      if (!post) {
        throw new Error(`Couldn't find post with id ${postId}`);
      }
      post.votes += 1;
      ee.emit("POST_SUBSCRIBE", { postSubscribe: post });
      return post;
    },
  },

  Subscription: {
    postSubscribe: {
      subscribe: () => on(ee, "POST_SUBSCRIBE"),
    },
  },

  Author: {
    posts: (author) => posts.filter((post) => post.authorId === author.id),
  },

  Post: {
    author: (post) => authors.filter((author) => author.id === post.authorId),
  },
};

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

export default schema;
```

We created a GraphQL schema with three functionalities:

- A query to retrieve all posts, as well resolvers for *Post* and *Author* to resolve nested fields.
- A mutation to upvote a post, which also announces the change to the `"POST_SUBSCRIBE"` event.
- A subscription to post updates that listens to the `"POST_SUBSCRIBE"` event.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  We use [events.on](https://nodejs.org/api/events.html#events_events_on_emitter_eventname_options)
to create the async iterator, but you may be more familiar with [graphql-subscriptions](https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-subscriptions))
</Callout>

## Create the server

Create a file called `server.js` and add the following:

```js
import { createServer } from "http";
import WebSocket from "ws";
import { Benzene, parseGraphQLBody, makeHandler } from "@benzene/http";
import { makeHandler as makeWsHandler } from "@benzene/ws";
import schema from "./schema";

function readBody(request) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    let body = "";
    request.on("data", (chunk) => (body += chunk));
    request.on("end", () => resolve(body));
  });
}

const GQL = new Benzene({ schema });

const graphqlHTTP = makeHandler(GQL);
const graphqlWS = makeWsHandler(GQL);

const server = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  const rawBody = await readBody(req);
  const result = await graphqlHTTP({
    method: req.method,
    headers: req.headers,
    body: parseGraphQLBody(rawBody, req.headers["content-type"]),
  });
  res.writeHead(result.status, result.headers);
  res.end(JSON.stringify(result.payload));
});

const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

wss.on("connection", (ws) => {
  graphqlWS(ws);
});

server.listen(3000);
```

### Parse incoming request

Our defined `readBody` function read the data from the incoming request and output it as a string.
Meanwhile, the [graphql-over-http spec](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http) allows different incoming [Content-Type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type),
each must be parsed differently. We provide `parseGraphQLBody` function, which accepts the body string and the content type, to do just that.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ’¡">
  You do not have to do this if you use a framework or library with body parsing, like [express](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#express.json)
</Callout>

### Create a Benzene instance and transport handlers

After creating an Benzene instance, we create HTTP and WebSocket handler by supplying the it to the `makeHandler` functions from
`@benzene/http` and `@benzene/ws`.

`@benzene/http` is then called with a generic request object and returns a generic response object with `status`, `headers`, and `payload` so we can respond
as we wish. This allows us to work with any frameworks or runtimes.

Similarly, `@benzene/ws` is called with any [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSocket)-like instance, so you can use it
with libraries other than `ws`.

<Callout emoji="ðŸ“¦">
  Benzene class is exported from both `@benzene/ws` and `@benzene/http`
