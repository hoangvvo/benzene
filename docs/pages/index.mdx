# Benzene

![benzene](/og.png)

**Benzene** is a fast and minimal JavaScript GraphQL Server. In Chemistry, it is a building block chemical. In JavaScript, it is the building block for your next API.

## Overview

```js
import express from "express";
import { Benzene, makeHandler } from "@benzene/http";

const app = express();

const GQL = new Benzene();

const graphqlHTTP = makeHandler(GQL);

app.use("/graphql", async (req, res) => {
  const result = await graphqlHTTP({
    method: req.method,
    query: req.query,
    body: req.body,
    headers: req.headers,
  });
  res.header(result.headers);
  res.status(result.status).send(result.payload);
});

app.listen(4000);
```

In this example, we create a GraphQL handler `graphqlHTTP` using a [Benzene instance](/reference/benzene). The instance will also be used in other libraries like `@benzene/ws`, allowing us to unify pipelines like error formatting in one place.

`graphqlHTTP` accepts a generic request object containing `method`, `query`, `body`, and `headers` and returns a generic response object containing `status`, `headers`, and `payload`. This allows it to work with any frameworks (or even runtimes):
[Node.js](./examples/with-http), [Deno](./examples/deno), [Cloudflare Worker](./examples/cloudflare-workers), etc.

As we can see, `graphqlHTTP` does nothing but executing the GraphQL request as it is, giving us full control in aspects like [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) or body parsing.
